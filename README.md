# Neural network - back propagation with Momentum term algorithm
Demonstration of learning simple back propagation neural network. This network shows how neural network learns simple problems, for example, logical operations. You can switch between classic back propagation algorithm or algorithm called Momentum term.

You can download Linux/X11 application from [releases](https://github.com/starek4/simpleNeuralNetwork/releases/latest).
