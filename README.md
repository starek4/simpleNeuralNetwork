# Neural network - back propagation with Momentum term algorithm
Demonstration of learning simple back propagation neural network. This network shows how is neural network learned for simple problems like logical operations. You can switch between classic back propagation algorithm or algorithm called Momentum term.

You can download Linux/X11 application from [releases](https://github.com/starek4/simpleNeuralNetwork/releases/latest).
